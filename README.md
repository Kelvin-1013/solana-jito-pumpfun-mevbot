# MEV Bot Solana

Welcome to the MEV Bot Solana repository! This project aims to develop a bot that takes advantage of MEV (Miner Extractable Value) opportunities on the Solana blockchain. 

## Introduction

MEV Bot Solana is a tool designed to monitor and execute transactions on the Solana network to gain profits through MEV strategies. The bot uses advanced techniques to detect and capitalize on arbitrage opportunities, liquidations, and other situations where value can be extracted.

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node.js package manager)
- Solana account with sufficient funds for transactions

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the MEV Bot Solana:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/Nicolopez603/mev-bot-solana.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd mev-bot-solana`

3. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`

4. Configure the environment variables:
  - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
  - Add the following variables and provide your own values:

    ```
    PRIVATE_KEY=<your_solana_private_key>
    RPC_URL=<URL_of_Solana_RPC_node>
    ```

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation and configuration, you can run the MEV Bot Solana by following these steps:

1. Start the bot: `npm start`

2. The bot will begin monitoring the Solana network for MEV opportunities.
3. When an opportunity is detected, the bot will automatically execute the necessary transactions to capitalize on it.
4. You can monitor the bot's activity and the profits earned in the console or in the generated logs.

## Examples

Here are some examples of MEV strategies that the bot can exploit:

- Arbitrage between different Solana exchanges.
- Liquidation of undercollateralized positions in lending protocols.
- Taking advantage of price discrepancies in trading pairs.

For more details on the implemented strategies, refer to the source code in the `src/strategies` directory.
